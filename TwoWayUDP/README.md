Is this a two-way communication?

Yes, it is a two-way communication.

The client sends a message to the server.
The server receives it, prints it, and replies.
The client receives the reply from the server and prints it.
This process continues until either the client or server sends "exit".
Both sides can send and receive messages, making it a two-way (bidirectional) communication using UDP.
